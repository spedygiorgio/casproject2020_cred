TODO list

Table 1 to put in appendix and to convert in figure

Table 2 => use kablextra

Numerical credibility application
__ use only train with cm(), select best formula on validation set
__ overall comparison on test company dataset (19124 rows)


Fullfill Section 5.2.4 on credibility 
__ explain the full process to select the most appropriate hierarchical formula (a clear difference with ML methods)
__ training time and predicting time 
__ explain how discretization was performed on continuous variables for Hierarchical BS => we use ForestDisc pkg

competitors pkg to perform dicretization are 
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/discretization/index.html
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RWeka/index.html 


start a github repository 
__ a subset of anonymized datasets data/illustrative_sample/ => either put csv and/or rdata file in CASdatasets
__ Python code
__ R code

Try a basic version of BS model* with only zone_id

* particularly used for small size datasets, e.g., reinsurance
